	"Open-source AI visibility tools let you self-host your brand tracking and read the exact code behind every metric.

		question: "Is there an open-source AI visibility tracker?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Elmo is an open-source AI visibility platform released under the MIT license, and you can self-host it for free. A few smaller open-source projects exist too, though the space is still early. For anything they don't cover, you can script your own checks against the AI model APIs.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I build my own AI visibility tool?",
		answer:
			"You can. The core loop is straightforward: send your prompts to the model APIs, directly or through a router like OpenRouter, parse each answer for brand mentions and citations, and log the results over time. The work is in maintaining it, covering enough engines, and running it at scale, which is what a finished tool handles for you.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the best DIY way to track AI mentions?",
		answer:
			"Define a small set of the questions your buyers ask, run them across the engines you care about on a schedule, and record whether each answer mentions or cites you. You can do this by hand for a quick read or script it against the provider APIs. Self-hosting Elmo gives you the same loop without building it yourself.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is Elmo really open source?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Every line of Elmo is open source under the MIT license and available on GitHub. You can read exactly how each metric is collected and computed, self-host it on your own infrastructure for free, and export your data at any time.",

				<DirectorySection title="Why open source matters here">
					<div className="max-w-3xl space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
						<p>
							Most AI visibility tools are closed and hosted. You send them your prompts, and you trust the score they
							hand back. Open source changes both halves of that deal. You can read how a metric is built, and you can
							run the whole thing on your own infrastructure, so your prompts and history never leave your environment.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a number that might land in a board report or shape a content budget, being able to audit it matters.
							So does owning your data outright, with no vendor holding your visibility history and nothing to migrate
							off if you decide to leave.
						</p>
					</div>
				</DirectorySection>

				<DirectorySection title="The open-source options">
					<p className="mb-6 max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
						The honest picture is that this is a thin, early space. Elmo is the most complete open-source option,
						released under the MIT license with broad engine coverage. The other open-source projects we track are
						below. They are smaller and earlier, but they are real and worth knowing about.
					</p>

						<ToolGrid competitors={tools} />
					) : (
						<p className="text-sm text-zinc-500">No other open-source trackers currently meet our bar.</p>
					)}
				</DirectorySection>

				<DirectorySection title="Build it yourself: scripting AI visibility checks">
					<div className="max-w-3xl space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
						<p>
							If no existing tool fits, the underlying job is not complicated to script. Send your prompts to the model
							APIs, directly or through a router like OpenRouter, then parse each response for your brand name and any
							links back to your site. Store the results and repeat on a schedule, because a single run is a snapshot
							and answers shift over time.
						</p>
						<p>
							The catch is everything around that loop. You have to cover enough engines, handle the ones without clean
							APIs, keep it running, and build some way to actually read the output. That upkeep is most of what you pay
							for when you buy a tool, or skip by self-hosting one that already does it.
						</p>
					</div>

				<DirectorySection title="Open source vs managed: the real tradeoffs">
					<p className="mb-6 max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
						Neither path is free of cost. Self-hosting trades a subscription for your own setup and infrastructure. A
						managed tool trades transparency and control for someone else doing the work.
